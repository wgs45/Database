## üè∞ Setting Up Your Realm: SCHEMA & TABLES

> üìñ _Let‚Äôs conjure our database kingdom: `taiwan_123456789`! It will hold all the life events from our municipalities‚Äîbirths, deaths, marriages, and more~_ üíû

### üß± Step 1: Create Your Magical SCHEMA

```sql
-- CREATE SCHEMA taiwan_123456789;
USE taiwan_123456789;
```

### üìö Step 2: Summon the Tables üìä

Each table represents a spellbook of data~ Let's craft them carefully~ üîÆ

```sql
CREATE TABLE municipality (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  `County` VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE movingin (
  municipality_id INT,
  `Difference` VARCHAR(50),
  `gender` TINYINT,
  `number of people` INT,
  `date` INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (municipality_id) REFERENCES municipality(id)
);

CREATE TABLE movingout (
  municipality_id INT,
  `Difference` VARCHAR(50),
  `gender` TINYINT,
  `number of people` INT,
  `date` INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (municipality_id) REFERENCES municipality(id)
);

CREATE TABLE divorce (
  municipality_id INT,
  `Difference` VARCHAR(50),
  `logarithm` INT,
  `date` INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (municipality_id) REFERENCES municipality(id)
);

CREATE TABLE marriage (
  municipality_id INT,
  `Difference` VARCHAR(50),
  `logarithm` INT,
  `date` INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (municipality_id) REFERENCES municipality(id)
);

CREATE TABLE birth (
  municipality_id INT,
  `Difference` VARCHAR(50),
  `gender` TINYINT,
  `number of people` INT,
  `date` INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (municipality_id) REFERENCES municipality(id)
);

CREATE TABLE death (
  municipality_id INT,
  `Difference` VARCHAR(50),
  `gender` TINYINT,
  `number of people` INT,
  `date` INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (municipality_id) REFERENCES municipality(id)
);
```

> üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **‚ú® Pro Tip:** Make sure your column names match your CSV headers‚Äîthis keeps the summoning ritual from failing! ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üì¶ Finding the Sacred Path: CSV File Directory

Before we can summon the data from the physical realm, we must locate the _blessed gate_ where MySQL permits file loading~ üóÇÔ∏è‚ú®

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv';
```

> üåà _This command reveals the special directory where your `.csv` files must reside to be summoned by `LOAD DATA INFILE`!_  
> üí° Example: `'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads'`

---

## ü™Ñ LOAD DATA Ritual: Feeding Your Tables from the Mortal Realm

üéâ _Let the data flow~!_ Here‚Äôs the ritual to invoke data into each table from `.csv` scrolls~ üßæüíï

```sql
-- LOAD movingout data
LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/TaiwanData/11310_movingout.csv'
INTO TABLE movingout
CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS
(municipality_id, difference, gender, number of people, date);
```

> üîÆ _Repeat the spell below with the correct file name and table name for each data type~_

---

### üìú Additional LOAD Spells

```sql
-- movingin
LOAD DATA INFILE '.../11310_movingin.csv' INTO TABLE movingin
CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS (municipality_id, difference, gender, number of people, date);

-- marriage
LOAD DATA INFILE '.../11310_marriage.csv' INTO TABLE marriage
CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS (municipality_id, difference, logarithm, date);

-- divorce
LOAD DATA INFILE '.../11310_divorce.csv' INTO TABLE divorce
CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS (municipality_id, difference, logarithm, date);

-- death
LOAD DATA INFILE '.../11310_death.csv' INTO TABLE death
CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS (municipality_id, difference, gender, number of people, date);

-- birth
LOAD DATA INFILE '.../11310_birth.csv' INTO TABLE birth
CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS (municipality_id, difference, gender, number of people, date);
```
