# 📌 Database System Development Process 🏗️

1️⃣ **Requirements Collection & Analysis** 🧐
2️⃣ **Conceptual Design** 🎨
3️⃣ **Selecting a Suitable Database System (DBS)** 💾
4️⃣ **Logical Design** 🧩
5️⃣ **Physical Design** 🏗️
6️⃣ **Implementation** 🚀

## 🔎 Requirement Collection & Analysis 🧐

- 📋 **Interview Users**: Analysts & DBAs gather requirements from users.
- 🛠️ **Use System Analysis Tools**: Tools like **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** help in analysis & documentation.

## 🏗️ Conceptual Design 🎨

- 📜 Collect **relevant documents & forms** (e.g., shipping orders, return orders...)
- 🗣️ Conduct **Interviews** with **operators, customers, and managers**.
- 🛠️ Use **Conceptual Tools** to express information **visually** for non-technical users.
- Commonly used tools: **Entity-Relationship Model (E-R Model)** 🔹

## 🫙 Selecting a Suitable Database System 💾

- 🐬 **MySQL**
- 🏢 **MSSQL**
- 🔄 **Others** (PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.)

## 🎲 Logical Design 🧩

- Convert the **Conceptual Design** into **Database Schema** (e.g., tables, relationships).
- 🔒 Define **Integrity Constraints** (rules to maintain data consistency).

## 🧱 Physical Design 🏗️

- Optimize **Storage, File Organization, and Indexing**.
- 🔥 Focus on **Efficiency (Speed & Space Optimization)**.

# 📌 Entities, Attributes & Relationships 🛜

## 🛠 Symbols in E-R Models 🔍

- 🔲 **Rectangles** → Represent **Entities** 🏢
- 🟢 **Ellipses** → Represent **Attributes** 📊
- 💎 **Diamonds** → Represent **Relationships** 🔗
- 📏 **Lines** → Connect **Entities & Attributes** 🔗
- 🟡 **Double Ellipse** → Represent **Multi-Valued Attributes** 📞📧
- 🔲 **Double Rectangle** → Represent **Weak Entities** 🛑

---

## 🔲 Entities 🏢

- **Objects in the real world that exist independently.**
- 🎓 **Examples:** Teachers, Students, Courses 📚
- Each record in an entity is called an **Instance** 📋

---

## 🟢 Attributes 📊

Used to **describe** entities. Types of attributes:

### 📍 General (Atomic) Attributes 🏷️

- **Single-value, indivisible attributes.**
- 🎓 Examples: **Price, Gender, Address, Birthday** 🎂

### 🏗️ Composite Attributes 🏷️

- **Attributes that can be divided into smaller subparts.**
- 🎓 Example: **Name → First Name + Last Name**

### 📞 Multivalued Attributes 📞📧

- **Can have multiple values.**
- 🎓 Example: A **Student** can have multiple **phone numbers** 📱

### 🧮 Derived Attributes 🧮

- **Values that can be calculated from other attributes.**
- 🎓 Example: **Age** can be derived from **Birthday** 🎂 → No need to store it!

### 🔑 Key Attributes 🔑

- **Unique attributes used to identify an instance (Primary Key, Candidate Key).**
- 🎓 Example: **Student ID, Employee Number**

---

## 💎 Relationships 🔗

Defines **associations between entities**.

### 🔢 Degree of Relationship

- **Unary** (Self-relationship)
- **Binary** (Between two entities)
- **Ternary** (Three entities involved)
- **N-ary** (More than three entities)

### 🔄 Cardinality Constraints 🔄

- 1️⃣ **One-to-One (1:1)**: Each entity has a single associated entity.
- 1️⃣➡️♾️ **One-to-Many (1:N)**: One entity connects to many others.
- ♾️↔️♾️ **Many-to-Many (M:N)**: Multiple entities are connected to multiple others.

### 📍 Participation Constraints

- 🔵 **Total Participation**: Every entity **must** participate.
- ⚪ **Partial Participation**: Some entities **may or may not** participate.

### 🆔 Identifying Relationships

- 🔗 **Weak Entities rely on Strong Entities** to exist.
- 🎓 Example: **Employees & Dependents** 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

---

## 🛑 Weak Entities 🆘

- Cannot exist **without a related strong entity**.
- 🏗️ **Types of Entities:**
  - ✅ **Strong Entity** → Exists independently.
  - 🛑 **Weak Entity** → Needs another entity to exist.

---

## 🔑 Partial Key (Discriminator) 🏷️

- **Used to identify weak entity instances related to the same strong entity.**
- 📍 **Dashed underline** represents a **Partial Key**.
- 🎓 Example: **Dependent's Name** (if dependents of the same employee won’t have identical names).

# 🎨 ER Diagram 📊

- ER Diagrams visually **represent entities, attributes, and relationships**.
- **Helps in designing & understanding the database structure!** 🛠️
