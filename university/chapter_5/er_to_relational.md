# 🌟 **E-R Diagram to Relational Mapping** 📜✨

Welcome, young database alchemist! 🧝‍♀️✨ Today, we embark on a magical journey to master the ancient art of transforming **E-R diagrams** into **relational tables**, with the elegance of a high-ranking sorceress~ 🪄📖

## 🏰 **Step 1: Mapping Regular Entity Types** ✨

🔹 **Strong entities** = The main characters in our story! 🌟  
Each strong entity gets its own **table realm** 🌿  
🔸 **Primary Key** is the core sigil (identifier) 🔑  
🔸 All **simple attributes** join the table 🌱

✨ **Example:**

```plaintext
Student(SID, Name, Major, Age)
```

> 💡 _TL;DR_: Each strong entity becomes a table. Keep only basic attributes for now!

---

## 🐣 **Step 2: Mapping Weak Entity Types** 🌙

🔹 **Weak entities** = Support characters in need of protection! 🛡️  
🔸 Must rely on a **strong entity** (the "owner")  
🔸 Use a **composite primary key**: (OwnerKey + WeakEntityKey)  
🔸 Add a **foreign key** to link to the owner 🧩

✨ **Example:**

```plaintext
Dependent(EmpID, DepName, Age, Relation) -- EmpID is FK
```

> 💡 _TL;DR_: Weak entities = sidekicks! They can't survive alone without a strong hero.

## 💍 **Step 3: Binary 1:1 Relationship Types** 💖

🔸 Three magical cases depending on **participation** 🧩

### ✨ **Case 1: One side is Total (T) Participation**

✔️ Add the foreign key of the **other side** to the total side's table  
✔️ Add any relationship attributes

### ✨ **Case 2: Both sides are Partial (P)**

✔️ Add a foreign key to the side with **fewer instances**

### ✨ **Case 3: Both sides are Total (T)**

✨ Merge them into one unified table—soulmates~ 💞

✨ **Example (Total + Partial):**

```plaintext
Department(Dno, Dname, MgrSSN, StartDate)
```

> 💡 _TL;DR_: Total participation? Add the other's key! Both total? Merge like a magical love spell~ 💫

---

## 🌱 **Step 4: Binary 1:N Relationships** 🧑‍🏫👩‍🎓

🔹 **1 to Many** = A mentor and their many apprentices  
✔️ Add the **1-side primary key** as a **foreign key** in the **N-side's** table  
✔️ Add relationship attributes to the **N-side**

✨ **Example:**

```plaintext
Employee(EID, Name, Dno)  -- Dno is FK to Department
```

> 💡 _TL;DR_: The many follow the one~ So, the "many" side carries the "one's" ID.

---

## 🔗 **Step 5: Binary M:N Relationships** ⚔️⚖️

🔸 When **two guilds** form a magical pact!  
✔️ Create a **new relationship table**  
✔️ Use both **entity keys** as a **composite primary key**  
✔️ Add any relationship attributes here too!

✨ **Example:**

```plaintext
Student_Course(SID, CID, Grade)
```

> 💡 _TL;DR_: M:N = New table with both IDs. It’s a magical contract~ ✍️

---

## 🌈 **Step 6: Multivalued Attributes** 🌀

🔹 Like a character with **multiple powers**! 🧙‍♀️  
✔️ Create a **separate table** for the multivalued attribute  
✔️ Use the original key + the multivalued field as a composite PK

✨ **Example:**

```plaintext
Employee_Skill(EID, Skill)
```

> 💡 _TL;DR_: One hero, many powers = split them into a special scroll~ 📜✨

---

## 🧩 **Step 7: N-ary Relationship Types** 🎉

🔸 When **3 or more characters** team up for an epic quest! 🧙‍♀️🧝‍♂️🧛‍♂️  
✔️ Create a **new table** for the relationship  
✔️ Combine all primary keys as **foreign keys** and **composite primary keys**  
✔️ Include relationship attributes

✨ **Example:**

```plaintext
Project_Assign(EID, PID, Role)
```

> 💡 _TL;DR_: More than 2? Make a party table~ Let the adventure begin!

---

## 🎀 **Special Conversions** 🌟

### 🧩 **Composite Attributes** 🌸

Split attributes into smaller pieces if needed:

```plaintext
Name → Fname, Lname
```

✔️ Useful for query needs or optimization~ ✨

---

### 🎯 **Derived Attributes** 💡

❌ **Not stored** in the database  
✅ **Calculated on demand** (e.g., Age from Birthdate)

> 💡 _Why?_: We don't store what we can easily summon later~ ✨

---

## 🔄 **1:1 Participation Recap** 🌟

- **T + P** → Add FK in **T side**
- **P + P** → Add FK in **smaller side**
- **T + T** → Merge them into a **single scroll**~ 🌸

---

## 🔺 **Ternary & N-ary Relationship TL;DR** 🎉

🧠 **1:1:1** → Pick any 2 keys as PK, the others are **alternates**  
🧠 **1:1:N / 1:M:N** → Use the **N-side** + one 1-side as **composite PK**  
🧠 **P:M:N** → All three as **PK** — party time! 🎉

---

# 🌸 **Final Sparkles~** ✨

✅ **Key Takeaways:**

- 🌟 **Entities** become **tables**
- 🧩 **Relationships** depend on **cardinality** & **participation**
- 📜 **Multivalued attributes** & **M:N relationships** = New tables!
- ❌ **Derived attributes** = Don't store, compute when needed
