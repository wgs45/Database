# 🌟 Introduction to DBMS (Database Management System) 🌟

---

## 📌 Types of DBMS

### 1️⃣ Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

- 📌 Data is organized into tables (relations) with rows and columns.
- 📌 Relationships between the data are managed through primary and foreign keys.
- 📌 Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulation.
- 🔹 **Examples**: MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL.

### 2️⃣ NoSQL DBMS

- 📌 Designed for high-performance scenarios and large-scale data.
- 📌 Stores data in various non-relational formats like key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or columns.
- 🔹 **Examples**: MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, Redis.

### 3️⃣ Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS)

- 📌 Stores data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming.
- 📌 Allows complex data representations and relationships.

## 📌 Database Languages

- 📍 **Data Definition Language (DDL)** 🛠️
- 📍 **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** 📊
- 📍 **Data Control Language (DCL)** 🔐
- 📍 **Transactional Control Language (TCL)** 💾

## 🛠️ Data Definition Language (DDL)

Used for defining and modifying database structures.

- 🔹 **CREATE** - Creates a database/table/index/view.
- 🔹 **ALTER** - Modifies the structure of an existing database.
- 🔹 **DROP** - Deletes database objects.
- 🔹 **TRUNCATE** - Removes all records from a table but retains structure.
- 🔹 **COMMENT** - Adds comments to the database dictionary.
- 🔹 **RENAME** - Renames database objects.

## 📊 Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Used for manipulating and managing data in a database.

- 🔹 **SELECT** - Retrieves data from a database.
- 🔹 **INSERT** - Inserts data into a table.
- 🔹 **UPDATE** - Updates existing records in a table.
- 🔹 **DELETE** - Removes records from a database table.
- 🔹 **MERGE** - UPSERT operation (Insert or Update).
- 🔹 **CALL** - Calls a PL/SQL or Java subprogram.
- 🔹 **EXPLAIN PLAN** - Shows the execution path of queries.
- 🔹 **LOCK TABLE** - Controls concurrency.

## 🔐 Data Control Language (DCL)

Used to grant and revoke user permissions.

- 🔹 **GRANT** - Provides user access rights.
- 🔹 **REVOKE** - Withdraws user access rights.

---

## 💾 Transactional Control Language (TCL)

Manages database transactions.

- 🔹 **ROLLBACK** - Undoes changes made in the database.
- 🔹 **COMMIT** - Saves changes permanently.
- 🔹 **SAVEPOINT** - Creates checkpoints for partial rollbacks.

## 📌 DBMS Architecture 🏛️

### 1️⃣ **One-Tier Architecture**

- 🔹 Direct database access by the user.
- 🔹 Simple setup, used in personal applications.
- 🔹 Example: **Microsoft Excel**.

### 2️⃣ **Two-Tier Architecture**

- 🔹 Client-server model.
- 🔹 The application communicates directly with the database.
- 🔹 Example: **Library Management System**.

### 3️⃣ **Three-Tier Architecture**

- 🔹 Includes an application server between the client and database.
- 🔹 Used for large-scale applications.
- 🔹 Example: **E-commerce platforms**.
